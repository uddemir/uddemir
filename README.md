<h3 align="center">Hello, Iâ€™m UÄŸur. Iâ€™m a computer engineering graduate. Iâ€™ve been playing digital games since I was a kid. When I realized that I could develop these games, I decided to become a game developer. Iâ€™m a passionate game developer dedicated to creating enjoyable gaming experiences. I worked as a game developer for 2 years and 7 months in a studio that develops Hyper-Casual games. During this experience, I improved my Unity game engine and C# language skills. I developed projects as a team. I want to create even more enjoyable games and I am constantly improving my skills.</h3>
